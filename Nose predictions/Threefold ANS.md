# The Threefold ANS Method by Krogman & Iscan, 1986[^2], as interpreted by Rynn et al. (2010)[^7]


The method interpretation for the threefold ANS by Krogman & Iscan, 1986[^2] in this guide is based on Rynn et al. (2010)[^7] and Taylor, 2001[^3]

They describe it as follows:

> “A line is projected, following the direction of the ANS, and the average soft tissue depth at mid-philtrum is vertically transposed up to it. The length of the ANS, from the vomer-maxillary junction (VMJ) to the acanthion (at the tip on the ANS) is tripled and added to the transferred average of soft tissue depth” (Krogman 1968[^2], Taylor, 2001[^3])

Stephan et al. 2003[^5] trialled _“substituting original nasal spine length for that determined by margin of most prominent lateral nasal aperture line to tip of nasal spine on lateral radiographs where the vomer was not detectable_ (referred in Rynn et al. 2010[^7] as PLB)”, but found larger margins of error. Therefore, the VMJ in this guide will be described as the junction of the vomer and maxilla (at the base of the nasal spine) and placed at the purple dot on figure 1 (modified from Grey's 1918[^6]).

> The sample CT (CBCT PreDentalSurgery) used in the screenshots of this guide does not have all the features (inion, bregma) that are to be landmarked. Please refer to the illustrations in the guide for correct placement. In addition, due to the CT being taken pre-surgery for an underbite, the error rate shown in the guide is probably not representative if implemented on a population without pathologies.

Illustration of the method: 

> [!WARNING]
> Before you proceed, please make sure you completed the following steps: 

- [ ] The scan has to be re-aligned in the FHP
- [ ] You should have a Bone and Skin model via segmentation (explained later)

You will establish a profile plane,  INB or MSP, based on which landmarks in the hard tissue landmark file you can place. 



### INB plane

To help with the side profile, we will establish the “INB” plane as defined by Rynn et al. 2010[^7]. 

> a midsagittal plane (INB) which bisected the inion, nasion and bregma

by downloading the hard tissue markups file for this method:

        f"Found: {found_labels}\n"

        f"Warning: Could not find all specified points.\n"
        f"The plane will be calculated using the {len(found_labels)} points that were found: {found_labels}"

### Segmentation
[link to step-by-step](https://github.com/esomjai/ForensicCraniofacialApproximationDatabase/blob/basics/003_Roi%20vs%20Segmentation.md)

You can hide all of these and keep only the models if you wish.

In case still need the red/green/yellow slice windows for precise landmark placement, keep only the original volume node (CTBrain in the example) and the models visible. 

### Profile view model

For this method, a profile view will be useful. 

To open the appropriate module, click on the magnifying glass icon next to the modules: 

![module](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08aeb820-240a-4cfd-a9c7-01d017c09c36)

And start typing “dynamic modeller” in the search bar.
![module2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9dfd153-3c8b-4e99-82a2-8ed83320aec7)

Click “Switch to Module” to open. 

You’ll see this menu on the left side of the screen: 

![dynamic-modeller](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/035ea262-8235-4665-8c4d-c3df49945944)

The "INB” or "MSP" is established in the environment. To cut the model along this plane (technically cutting it in 2 and choosing which side to keep), choose the first button (Plane Cut).


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c297c00-d350-4994-9386-1e2aea9e3e25)

Make sure you create your cut model with the settings on the screenshot to cut the Bone model at the INB Plane: 

- [ ] Make sure the source volume is the full model of the Bone
- [ ] Choose INB/MSP as the plane node
- [ ]  Operation type should be **Intersection**
- [ ]  You MUST chose the **Create new model as...** from the drop-down menu and type in the custom name with the side prefix - otherwise you'll override your existing models. This time, the negative output will be the right side of the cut and the positive side is the left side
- [ ] DO NOT FORGET TO CLICK APPLY


- [ ] Check if this was executed by finding your 2 new models under the "Models" module

With these settings, the Model list will be the following: 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca5973b4-e666-4070-8a1c-e1c12584bf46)



And you should have the following individual views (excluding/hiding the original full models for demonstration purposes):

<img src="(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c18929a-71af-4793-a502-f02438d7ee68)" width="500">


You can now allocate the remainder of the landmarks on either model - they should appear on ALL of them. 


### Establishing the acanthion vector
Re-orient the view of either your left-bone model to see its right side OR your right-bone model to see its left side to look inside the cranium: 

To establish the tangent described as in the general direction of the acanthion, like an arrow, manually draw a vector in the general direction of the acanthion by going to “Markups” >”line” and creating a tangent relatively in the vicinity of the reference plane (INB or MSP). Name this line “aca vector” (by double clicking on the name automatically added to the line - likely "L"- and typing it in)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57341433-009a-47cf-be85-a6fd329fa4b8" width="500">


Now, execute the **aca vector to INB/MSP** code  that projects the lines to the INB/MSP, ensures that it bisects the acanthion and elongates the line in both directions.

### Mid-philtrum and reference to mp
The hard tissue mid-philtrum is defined as the _Median point midway between subspinale and prosthion_ – therefore a line connecting the subspinale and prosthion can be established and the midline found programmatically, which is a visual guide to allocate the **mp** landmark via the script below, that also creates the VMJ-acanthion distance. 

<details>

<summary>Mid-philtrum landmark & VMJ-aca line (Improved Logic)</summary>

```python
import numpy as np
import slicer
from slicer.util import getNode
from qt import QMessageBox 

# Get the Markups node for 'KrogmanIscan_hard_tissue'
hardTissueNode = getNode('KrogmanIscan_hard_tissue')

# Add the midpoint to the 'KrogmanIscan_hard_tissue' node and set its label to "mp"
midpointIndex = hardTissueNode.AddControlPoint(midpoint)
hardTissueNode.SetNthControlPointLabel(midpointIndex, "mp")

# Show a popup message to remind the user
msg = QMessageBox()
msg.setIcon(QMessageBox.Information)
msg.setWindowTitle("Reminder: Adjust Midpoint")
msg.setText(
    "Please move the new 'mp' point so it sits on the surface of the maxilla.\n\n"
    "You can use the Markups control point editing tool to adjust its position as needed."
)
msg.addButton("Noted!", QMessageBox.AcceptRole)
msg.exec_()
```

</details>

If this "mp" does not meet the model, you may have to manually allocate it onto the surface of the maxilla. The script saves "mp" in the "hard tissue" node, in case you'd have to re-allocate or find it.

### Predict Pronasale

The following script uses calculations based on the bone model's surface normals and the RAS (Right-Anterior-Superior) coordinate system. The default FSTT (facial soft tissue thickness) value is 11.5mm based on [Hona and Stephan 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-023-03087-x)'s study[^11], and the multiplier is set to 3.0× ANS (Krogman and Iscan, 1986).

After placing the FFST "peg" perpendicularly to the adjusted mp point with the aforementioned length; a line from the FSTT cylinder's anteriormost endpoint is drawn. This line is parallell to the nasal spine vector line and its length is calculated by the original Krogman-Iscan formula (3xANS=3xVMJ-aca). 

There is another method included in the [GUI](https://github.com/esomjai/Forensic-Craniofacial-Approximation-Database/blob/cf1ead1c8511af060ad219252b803955ba30c53a/Nose%20predictions/Threefold%20ANS%20GUI.md), specifically cerated on an elderly population. 
Matsuda et al. (2023)[^12] revised the original equation to 1.9xANS for their population - however, this comes with their caveat of the midphiltrum FSTT being extremely variable in the elderly. Therefore, the GUI allows for manual adjustment of the average value.

### Error Calculation

To validate the prediction against known soft tissue landmarks, make sure you downloaded and allocated  [KrogmanIscan_soft_tissue.mrk.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20234679/KrogmanIscan_soft_tissue.mrk.json) 

Then, copy and paste the following script that creates lines between the predicted and true pronasale and give coordinates of the same.

# Get true soft tissue landmarks
trueSoftTissueNode = getNode('KrogmanIscan_soft_tissue')
