 [Stephan et al. 2003](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.10300)[^2] compared three methods on lateral cephalogram tracings:  method 1 by Gerasimov[^3] (1971); method 2 by Krogman[^4] (1962); method 3 by Stephan and colleagues; and decided that method 3 "performed the best on the basis of having more predictions within 5mm, a narrower range of prediction errors and smaller standard errors" [^2]. Their method uses linear regressions based on hard tissue measurements to produce pronasale (nose tip) predictions on 100 individuals.  


> [! NOTE]
> The method is illustrated by the 3D Slicer[^1] Sample Data for Post Dental Surgery CT in screenshots.  For representing the general population, individuals without facial surgery would be chosen for reconstruction or validation studies. 
> The performance of this  method was later compared with Rynn et al. (2010)[^7] in a validation study by Mala et al. (2016)[^8].
> The script snippets show **INB** as the only plane, but the GUI for this method also features an option for a differently defined **MSP** (midsagittal plane) as best fit for nasion, rhinion, acanthion, point A and prosthion.

The guide contains the following steps:  

- Allocating [landmarks](#landmarks-in-this-guide): Please note this file contains landmarks for replicating both methods, but the codes remain unaffected - just omit placing the ones you do not need.
- Establishing the [INB Plane](#inb-plane)
- Establishing the [x and y axes](#establishing-the-x-and-y-axes) 
- Creating [Point X](#creating-point-x-via-aa-fhp) via AA FHP
- Replicating the original measurements:  [nasal bone angle](#measuring-the-nasal-bone-angle); [measurement C](#setup-for-measurement-c); [measurement B](#setting-up-lines-for-measurement-b); [measurement D](#angle-d---nasal-spine-angle); [measurement E](#measurement-e)
- Applying the linear regressions by Stephan et al. 2003[^2] to predict the [pronasale](#prediction-point---pronasale) position:  divided by biological sexes.

### Illustration of the method:  

> [!WARNING]
> Before you proceed, please make sure you completed the following steps:  

- [ ] The scan has to be re-aligned in the FHP
- [ ] You should have a Bone and Skin model via segmentation [link to step-by-step](https://github.com/esomjai/ForensicCraniofacialApproximationDatabase/blob/basics/003_Roi%20vs%20Segmentation.md)

### INB plane

To help with the side profile, we will establish the "INB" plane as defined by Rynn et al. 2010. 

> a midsagittal plane (INB) which bisected the inion, nasion and bregma

by downloading the [markups file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20213400/lmrks_Stephan. mrk.json) for this method and allocating all landmarks on the Bone model or volume. 
This is a pre-emptive measure to facilitate the later steps:  by having the INB and FHP as planes and the following codes containing restrictions in the establishment of later reference planes, the codes should perform without further adjustments. 

<details>
<summary>Code for INB</summary>
```python
import numpy as np
import slicer

# Get the points from the "lmrks_Stephan" node
hardTissueNode = slicer.util. getNode('lmrks_Stephan')
point1 = np.array(hardTissueNode.GetNthControlPointPosition(0))
point2 = np.array(hardTissueNode.GetNthControlPointPosition(1))
point3 = np.array(hardTissueNode.GetNthControlPointPosition(2))

# Calculate the normal of the plane defined by the three points
v1 = point2 - point1
v2 = point3 - point1
planeNormal = np.cross(v1, v2)
planeNormal = planeNormal / np.linalg.norm(planeNormal)  # Normalize the normal vector

# Create a new plane node
newPlaneNode = slicer. mrmlScene.AddNewNodeByClass('vtkMRMLMarkupsPlaneNode', 'INB')

# Set the origin of the new plane to the first point
newPlaneNode.SetOrigin(point1)

# Set the normal of the new plane
newPlaneNode.SetNormal(planeNormal)

```

View after landmarks were placed, the code above employed and INB extended via the toggles (dots)

The following steps can be executed in one step by copy & pasting the entire code, but for the sake of explanation, the tutorial breaks it down to its components.  The method also splits into male and female formulas for the final prediction. 

### Establishing the x and y axes
The code creates an x axis in green, defined as a line bisecting the nasion landmark and parallel to the FHP, while being on the INB plane.  
The code creates a y axis in navy, defined as a line bisecting the nasion landmark and perpendicular to the FHP, while being on the INB plane.  

Make sure you have a plane based on the 4 landmarks of the Frankfurt Horizontal Plane and is named "FHP", then employ this snippet:

### Creating point X via AA FHP
The code creates a line called "AA FHP" in turquoise along the INB which is parallel to the FHP and bisects point AA - this is later needed to establish point X. 
The next part of the same code snippet creates a new "point X" node defined as the point that falls on nasion-point A plane (perpendicular to y axis, parallel to AA FHP) at height of point AA and also on a plane defined by nasion and point A.

### Measuring the nasal bone angle
This angle is described as the **A)** variable in the original study as measured from nasion to rhinion, from Frankfurt horizontal.  Based on our previously created lines, this means that the apex is the nasion, the first point is the anterior end of our x axis (a line parallel to FHP which bisects our nasion) and the last point is the rhinion.

### Setup for measurement C
The following steps prepare to execute measurement C) in the original study, defined as distance from rhinion to most posterior point on nasal aperture border, measured perpendicular to nasion/acanthion line. 
The LL and LR axes also help with the "line-instead-plane" process lines by bisecting the most posterior part of the nasal aperture from lateral view on the left and right, perpendicular to AA FHP and on the INB.

### Setting up lines for measurement B
Line "for b-ac" is a line perpendicular to AA FHP which bisects the acanthion; line "for b – LL" is a line perpendicular to AA FHP which bisects the LL point and is projected onto the INB plane.  Measurement B is the shortest distance between the two lines.

### Prediction point - pronasale

Stephan et al. 2003 divides the prediction equations by biological sex to predict distances along axes x and y; then find the intersection as the pronasale (soft nose tip). In this section, we apply the formulas and create the final predicted pronasale landmark.

**Prediction Formulas:**

For **Females:**
- F(x) = -0.41 * nasal_bone_angle + 0.37 * line_B_value + 49.87
- F(y) = (-0.002 * nasal_spine_angle + 0.83) * line_E_value

For **Males:**
- M(x) = -0.32 * nasal_bone_angle + 0.85 * line_B_value - 0.42 * line_C_value + 49.58
- M(y) = (-0.002 * nasal_spine_angle + 0.83) * line_E_value

### Output

To export your measurements:
o copy all measurements to the clipboard, follow this guide

In the example, we will show the output of the scenario where the biological sex is known and all angle D) definitions are carried out to test which one is most precise in prediction. The codes do not include the biological sex in the output, so make sure you note it in your data collection table. We copied the linear measurements first, then the angles:
