# Forensic Craniofacial Approximation Database
Often comparisons of the theoretical and anatomical basis, data collection methods, reliability and success rates, as well as details of the sample population used to establish these guides cannot be readily made due to their heterogeneity, leaving them to interpret these recommendations and assess their limitations.
To improve repeatibility of forensic craniofacial approximation methods, this project aims to “translate” well-known techniques into the world of medical imaging and Python with the help of the open-source programme, 3D Slicer. Please visit their official website for  more information and free download.

All methodology was developed on [NMDID](https://nmdid.unm.edu/welcome) post-mortem CTs but are shown in the guides using the Sample Data by 3D Slicer which is  openly accessible.

If this is your first time working with Slicer, please start in the "Start here" folder and First Steps.md file.

When noticing any errors, please contact me!

This is a work in progress repository, so take everything with a pinch of salt :)
