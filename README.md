# ForensicCraniofacialApproximationDatabase
Often comparisons of the theoretical and anatomical basis, data collection methods, reliability and success rates, as well as details of the sample population used to establish these guides cannot be readily made due to their heterogeneity, leaving them to interpret these recommendations and assess their limitations.
To improve repeatibility of forensic craniofacial approximation methods, this project aims to “translate” well-known techniques into the world of medical imaging and Python with the help of the open-source programme, 3D Slicer. Please visit their official website for  more information and free download.
If this is your first time working with Slicer, please start at the Back to Basics Release.
